Types of Files
 The attached files are including such as

•	Data.rar

•	Model.py

•	pre-process1

•	pre-process2

•	pre-process3

•	test.final.features.xlsx

•	train. final. features.zip

Guide

•	The Data.rar relies on residue by residue. Thus, it includes two files that contain Fast A sequences.

•	Pre-processing1,2, 3 are pre-required to run model.py.

•	model.py is the proposed method (IntPPPred).

•	test.final.features.xlsx and train. final. features.xlsx are basic (low-level) features.

model.py is the main file. To run, all the above files should be provided in one folder. Run in Linux: python model.py to predict the peptide binding regions in proteins.
